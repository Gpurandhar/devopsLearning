++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Objective:

To set up and configure ngrok for exposing localhost services to the internet.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prerequisites:

A valid ngrok account. Sign up at ngrok.com.

ngrok installed on your system.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Procedure:

Step 1: Log in to ngrok Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/.

Sign in to your ngrok account or create a new account if you donâ€™t already have one.

Once logged in, locate your AuthToken under the "Your Authtoken" section of the dashboard.



Step 2: Copy Your AuthToken

Copy the AuthToken provided in the ngrok dashboard. It will look something like this:

Step 3: Configure the AuthToken

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to add your AuthToken to ngrok:

ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN

Replace YOUR_AUTHTOKEN with the AuthToken you copied in Step 2.



Step 4: Verify Configuration

If the command runs successfully, you will see a confirmation message.

This indicates that ngrok is now configured with your AuthToken.



Step 5: Start ngrok

Run the following command to expose your localhost service to the internet:

ngrok http 8080

Replace 8080 with the port number of the service you want to expose.



Step 6: Share the Public URL

ngrok will generate a public URL (e.g., https://xyz123.ngrok.io).

Share this URL with others to access your localhost service.

Troubleshooting:

If you encounter an error like authentication failed, ensure:

You have copied the correct AuthToken.

Consider restricting access to the ngrok URL by implementing authentication or IP whitelisting where possible.
